Smoking-dataset-from-Google-Trends
==================================

This repository contains the smoking related search query trend data downloaded from Google Trends. We used “smoking” and
“tobacco” as the search query terms to collect the search query trend data about smoking behavior in five main 
English-speaking countries (i.e., the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand). We also used “吸烟” and “烟草” as 
the query terms for the trend data in China.The category of the above search volume was limited to health so that such 
category can exclude the search queries irrelevant with the act of smoking tobacco or other substances. The time interval 
covered by our data is from January 4, 2004 to December 29, 2012, which contains 469 weeks.
